		FIG4 of paper shows sequence analysis of K. lactis STN1 gene and homologues from S. cerevisiae (Sc) and Candida glabrata (Cgl) (GenBank accession numbers P_38960 and XP_448655, respectively).
	BUT NCBI says "The following term was not found in Nucleotide: P_38960."for P_38960. XP_448655 is here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/XP_448655. 
	I couldn't find the sequence for K. lactis they were talking about ... I think it's NCBI Reference Sequence: XM_452728.1 Kluyveromyces lactis uncharacterized protein (KLLA0_C11825g), partial mRNA BECAUSE /note="weakly similar to uniprot|P38960 Saccharomyces

	* ALT proposedtemplate extension of teloemres w/ HR, BUT getic / epigenetic changes aren't fully known. this paper used genomic, molecular  biological and cell biological sciencyi9ng on panel of 22 ALT cell lines (haz lines derived in vitro). loss of ATRX protein + ATRX gene mutations are feature of ALT lines. ALT linked w/ genome rearrangements, micronucleation and wacky DSB repair ... these diagnositc features may help to identify ALT.

	* lack of DNMT INCREASED telomeric recombination (T-SCE) and APBs. authors conclude that increased telomeric recombination MIGHT lead to telomere length changes, BUT they do not exclude the invovlement of telomerase in the aberrant telomere elongation, BUT here are two papers that better describe the link!!!!

	* TEL+ cells had hyperacetylation of H3 and H4 and methylation of Lys4H3. 
	* Treatment w/ 5 AZC and Trichostatin A => chromatin remodeling hTR, hTERT and therefore expression. 
	* ALT+ methylated Lys20 Histone H4 not associated w/ gene expression, but does seem ALT-specific ... new marker?
	* authors propose ALT may arise from tight repression of hTR and hTERT promoters ... possibly why MSC go ALT?!?

#### Identifying the hTERT CpG Island Region
	Kumakura 2005 found the hTERT CpG island to be from 654 bp upstream to 510 bp downstream of the ATG start codon. 

	Cong 1999 The human telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT: organization of the gene and characterization of the promoter
	Kumakura 2005 Reversible Conversion of Immortal Human Cells from Telomerase-Positive to Telomerase-Negative Cells
	I want to explore hTERT promoter CpG island methylation, BUT I'll need to do some digging to get the sequence and identify the CpG island region. Cong 1999 reports that the core hTERT promoter region is from -330 to +361 bp of the ATG start codon. HOWEVER, that doesn't necessarily imply the CpG region to be ONLY from -330 to +361bp (see next section).

	Kumakura 2005
	the hTERT CpG island which is from 654 bp upstream of the putative
	transcription start site to 510 bp downstream of the transcription start site
	were the same as those described by Dessain et al. (8) 
	8 is Dessain SK, Yu H, Reddel RR, Beijersbergen RL,
	Weinberg RA. Methylation of the human telomerase
	gene CpG island. Cancer Res 2000;60:537–41.

	Dessain 2000
	On the basis of the quantitative
	criteria proposed by Antequera and Bird (18), this CpG island is from
	654 bp upstream of the putative transcription start site (6) to 510 bp
	downstream of the transcription start site, ending 56 bp after the start
	of the first intron (6 – 8, 18). 5
	Within this region, the DNA has a GC
content of 74% and a CG:GC ratio of 0.87

	Cong 1999 start codon of ATG seems to be on line 1 of the hTERT
	"ATGCCGCGCGCT" is end of the line, which is 59 in from the left (59 is A of atg)
	CpG is 654 bp upstream of transcriptoin start site, SO 595 back from current start
	SO 1253167-595 = 1252572 should be start site now
	I might be off by 1 or so, BUT I nkow that its 654 upstream of start to 510 bp downstream of start site (ending 56 bp after start of first intron). I can check the m ath on that location to be sure :)
	I THINK I WAS BACKWARDS?!?
	What about 1295047 + 595 = 1295642 YESSSSSSS, that's right :)
now i have more at the beginniig, so "atgccgcgcgctccccgct" is fully searchable!

# Introns
a segment of a DNA or RNA molecule that does not code for proteins and interrupts the sequence of genes.


# Exons
a segment of a DNA or RNA molecule containing information coding for a protein or peptide sequence.


# Promoters
n genetics, a promoter is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene. Promoters are located near the transcription start sites of genes, on the same strand and upstream on the DNA (towards the 3' region of the anti-sense strand).


# Open Reading Frames
In molecular genetics, an open reading frame (ORF) is the part of a reading frame that has the ability to be translated. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that begins with a start codon (usually AUG) and ends at a stop codon (usually UAA, UAG or UGA).
























========================
# Transcription and Translation Review (Python & R)
I recently mixed up Exons with Introns :S ... here's a review of Exons, Introns, Promoters, and Open Reading Frames with examples done in R Studio & Python:

#### Exons and Introns (Python)
These programs can be found in the Exons_and_Introns folder:
* DNA_to_RNA_Simple_String.py takes a simple DNA string as input and returns an RNA string.
* RNA_to_AA_Simple_String.py takes a simple RNA string as input and returns a protein string. It *does* take stop codons into account, but this version can only do one reading frame. 
* Splicing_Out_Introns_1.py returns a sequence of ONLY the coding regions of the DNA string.
* Splicing_Out_Introns_2.py returns a sequence of ONLY the coding regions of the DNA and it returns the percentage of coding DNA.
* Splicing_Out_Introns_3.py returns a sequence of coding bases as UPPER CASE and non-coding bases as lowercase.
* RNA_Splicing.py is a simple example of removing the introns from a small RNA string.
* NOTE: These programs assume only one reading frame and one DNA string. Computing all six reading frames is *way* beyond my skills! I SHOULD DO AN EXAMPLE WITH BIOPYTHON: https://www.biostars.org/p/97746/

#### Promoter Regions (R Studio)
These files can be found in the Promoters folder:
* how_to_extract_promoters_positions.Rmd is an R tutorial that I followed on determinging promoter regions from TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene.
* TF_Binding_to_DNA_Promoter_Regions.Rmd is an R tutorial that I followed for searching out potential transcription factor / DNA promoter region interactions.  

#### Detecting Open Reading Frames (Python, R Studio)
These files can be found in the Open_Reading_Frames folder:
* identifying_open_reading_frames.py is a BioPython tutorial for finding ORFs.
* identifying_open_reading_frame_positions.py is a BioPython tutorial for finding the positions of ORFs. 
* ORFik_Overview.Rmd is an R Studio tutorial that I completed on ORFik, which is a package for exploring open reading frames. 
* FindingGenesWithORFs.py this is an incorrect solution to a Rosalind.info ORF problem ... trying to figure things out.
