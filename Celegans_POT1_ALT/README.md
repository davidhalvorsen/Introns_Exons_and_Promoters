Cheng 2012 Caenorhabditis elegans POT-2 telomere protein represses a mode of alternative lengthening of telomeres with normal telomere lengths
* The C. elegans genome harbors four genes that encode
homologs of mammalian Protection Of Telomeres 1 (POT1),
a protein that binds single-stranded telomeric DNA via two oli-
gosaccharide/oligonucleotide (OB) folds, OB1 and OB2 (30–32).
* C. elegans MRT-1, a dual-domain protein comprised of an OB2
fold fused to an interstrand cross-link repair domain, is required for
telomerase-mediated telomere repeat addition in vivo (31),
whereas worms lacking POT-3, which also harbors an OB2 fold,
exhibit wild-type telomeres (32). 
* Deficiency for the POT-2 telomere protein in either trt-1 or mrt-2 telomerase-defective backgrounds yielded ALT strains with distinctly normal telomere lengths.
* deficiency for pot-2
specifically promotes the frequency of survival via ALT, whereas
deficiency for pot-1 results in ALT strains that possess fewer
chromosome fusions.
* The high frequency of trt-1; pot-2 survivors
is consistent with a role for the POT-2 OB2 fold protein in binding
and protecting the 3′ end of a chromosome (32), where ALT could
initiate by engaging an illegitimate replication or recombination
mechanism (Fig. 4A).
* In addition, ALT strains deficient for pot-2
had predominantly normal telomere lengths, suggesting that POT-
2 could promote bursts of ALT activity that lead to long and het-
erogeneous telomeres, or that it may function to repress trimming
of long telomeres (Fig. 4A), which is a natural process that can act
on ALT and non-ALT telomeres alike (39).
