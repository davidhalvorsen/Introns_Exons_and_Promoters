# Project Ideas
* Data to get:
	* human ATRX
	* human POT-1
	* human TP53
	* C elegans pot-1, pot-2, trt-1, mrt-2
	* yeast ALT genes
* ATRX gene => ATRX protein. compare to entry.
* human POT1 to yeast pot 1 (and terc) compare commonality. comparing human POT1 to c elegans pot-1 (isoforms 1-3) and pot-2
* identify protein in whole chromosome? pot-1? 
* c elegans pot-1 isoforms


CONFUSING
NOT IMPORTANT
* what's with having c remanei gene,but only c elegans mrna?


# Paper Discussion
* ATRX exon issues are associated w/ ALT in humans
* pot-1 and pot-2 deficiency initiates ALT in telomerase-defective c elegans
* 


# Paper Notes
* Gocha 2013 Alternative mechanisms of telomere lengthening: permissive mutations, DNA repair proteins and tumorigenic progression
* 19/22 ALT cell lines had loss or mutations in ATRX gene. 
	* Lovejoy 2012 mutations in ATRX/DAXX chromatin remodeling complex correlated with ALT features.   
*   Deficiency for the POT-2 telomere protein in either trt-1 or mrt-2 telomerase-defective backgrounds yielded ALT strains with distinctly normal telomere lengths. deficiency for pot-2 specifically promotes the frequency of survival via ALT, whereas deficiency for pot-1 results in ALT strains that possess fewer chromosome fusions. 
	* Cheng 2012 Caenorhabditis elegans POT-2 telomere protein represses a mode of alternative lengthening of telomeres with normal telomere lengths.
